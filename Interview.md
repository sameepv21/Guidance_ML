#### Question 1 
What is the difference between standardization and normalization

#### Answer 1
* Normalization is a scaling method in which data points are shifted and rescaled so that they end up in a range of 0 to 1. Also called min max scaling. Example can be for examinations conduction in two shifts A and B where A were relatively easy and B was a bit difficult. Hence the scores of students in both these sets are not comparable and hence normalization is used.
* Another scaling method where the values are centersed around the mean with a unit standard deviation. Calculated using z-score. Give an example of z-test. Two university exams and compare who performed better relative to other students who appeared in that exam.
* Normalization preferred over standardization when our data doesn't follow a normal distribution. Standardization is good to use when our data follows a normal distribution. Unlike normalization, standardization doesn't have a bounding range i.e 0 to 1. Also, it is not influenced by maximum or minimum values.
* Standardization doesn't affect skewness but normalization does reduce it.

#### Question 2
What are the mathematical concepts that you know? (Eg. in statistics, in CLA etc.)

#### Answer 2
* Differential Calculus
* Probability
* CLT
* WLLN
* Linear Algebra
    * Vectors and Scalers

#### Question 3
Layman definition of first and second order derivative?

#### Answer 3
* Getting equation for the slope of a function at hand (can be a cost function)
* Significane for ML is that it is used in Gradient Descent.

#### Question 4
What is the meaning of ensemble techniques and what do we do when using ensemble technique for regression?

#### Answer 4

#### Question 5
How will the dataset be splitted while training random forest? Can the splitting be done row-wise and column-wise? If yes, how?

#### Answer 5


#### Question 6
What is bootstrap and cross validation method? What is the difference between both?

#### Answer 6

#### Question 7
* What is your understanding of neural network?
* What all are the components of NN?
* Why do we need neural network when we have excellent models for the same using standard machine learning algorithms?

#### Answer 7

#### Question 8
* What are activation functions and why are they needed? Further, which activation function to use when?

* Q-A application - Stemming or **lemmatization**? Sentiment analysis - **Stemming** or lemmatization?

#### Answer 8

#### Question 9
What is the use of lemmatization and stemming? When should we use them respectively?

### Extras
* Apart from these, one must have in depth mathematical knowledge about majority of the algorithms.
* One should know its assumptions, its parameters, its hyperparameters, its loss functions, its metric, its usage, its alternatives (if any) and about its effectivness and robustness (whether it will overfit or not (For eg. RF does not overfit but LR does))
* One should also know every thing about optimizers and usage of momentum in it etc.
* Further, one should know architecture of various libraries and frameworks used, its advantages, disadvatages, its features etc.
