# Introduction
* To visualize higher dimension vectors, we use PCA.
* Use PCA to reduce the number of features to 2 or 3.
* Then, use simple plots to visualize the words represented by vector spaces.
* This is important because we can verify whether our vector representations are capturing relationship expected or not.

> **Know how PCA works mathematically and how to reduce the dimensions.**
