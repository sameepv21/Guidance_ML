# Introduction
* Normalizing the input means that we are making the mean of the dataset to be 0 and variance to be 1.
* Note that whatever value of mean and variance you take in the training set, that same has to be taken in the testing set.
* This is to ensure that we dont mess up with the test set and it follows similar distribution as training set.

# Why normalization?
* If we use unnormalized features then the cost function can be very sqeezed in and might not be a good cost function overall.
* Elongted contours vs symmetric contours.
