* Parameters are the weights and bias.
* Hyperparameters are learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of hidden units, choice of activation function.
* Thus, the difference between hyperaparameter and parameter is that the former ones are those that control the latter ones.
* There are many number of hyperparameters in deep learning.
