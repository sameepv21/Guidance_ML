    * Reading data and converting to pandas dataframe
    * Dropping or adding some columns
    * Running some calculations over the columns
    * Normalizing the data
    * Performing data extractions
    * Creating training models
    * Tuning the algorithm
    * Releasing it to production
* Used to help automate machine learning workflows.
