* Polynomial Regression
* Step Functions
* Regression Splines
* Smoothing Splines
* Local Regression
* GAN (Generalized Additive Models)

# Polynomial Regression
* Note that generally degrees should not exceed 3 or 4 because it may lead to overfitting issue.
* Else it is very similar to linear regression.

# Step Functions
* Break the range of X into bins and fit a different constant in each bin.
* This amounts to converting a continious vairbale into an ordered categorical variable.
