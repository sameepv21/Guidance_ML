* Conditional maximum likelihood

# Formalizing NN
* Define a parameterized family of functions
* Define a loss function
* Define a training criterion and a regularizer
* Define an optimization procedure
* An unsupervised loss can be solely defined as a function of input x and some function f(x) that one wished to learn.
