# Introduction
* There are three types of layers
    * Convolutional Layers
    * Pooling Layers
    * Fully Connected Layers

# Pooling Layers
* One pooling method is called max pooling
* Just take the max for each block of 4.
* Thus, the hyperparameters for max pooling are f = 2 and s = 2 (for a output of 2x2).
>  **Must look at the purpose of pooling layers and intuition for max pooling layer.**
