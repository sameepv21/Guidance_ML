# Introduction
* Data Augmentation is a set of techniques used to increase the amount of data in a machine learning model by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data.
* Helps smooth out the ML model and reduce overfitting of data.

# Advantages
* Performance Improves
* Overfitting reduces
* Cost effective method as collecting more data can become costly

# Techniques
* GAN Based
* Geometric transformations
* Elastic transformations
* Flipping
* Color modification
* Cropping
* Rotation
* Translation
* Noise Injection
* Zoom and scaling
* Random Erasing
* Numerical
    * SMOTE
