# Introduction
* Data Augmentation is a set of techniques used to increase the amount of data in a machine learning model by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data.
* Helps smooth out the ML model and reduce overfitting of data.

# Advantages
* Performance Improves
* Overfitting reduces
* Cost effective method as collecting more data can become costly

# Disadvantages
* No new information is passed to the model except in GANs.

# Techniques
* GAN Based
* Geometric transformations
* Elastic transformations
* Flipping
* Color modification
* Cropping
* Rotation
* Noise Injection
* Zoom and scaling
* Brightness
* Random Erasing
* Numerical
    * SMOTE
    * SMOTE NC

# Others
* Flipping just means mirroring the image i.e either left-right or upside-down.
* Color modification means we can convert an rgd image to grayscale.
* Cropping means we crop to a certain part of the image.
* Rotation just means we rotate the image at various degrees.
* Noise injection means we randomly inject gaussian noise.
* Zoom/Scaling means either we zoom in to a specific region of image or scale down individual pixel values.
* Brightness means that we can change the brightness of the image (either increase or decrease).
