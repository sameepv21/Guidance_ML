# Statistical Learning
* Trade off between flexibility and interpretability.
    * Less flexible models have higher interpretability and vice versa.
* Parametric Vs Non Parametric
    * In parametric approach, we assume the same of the function that we need to estimate and then use the performance measurement to evaluate the function.
    * Non-parametric approach does not assume anything about the shape of the function.
* Supervised Vs Unsupervised
    * Supervised means that for each observation of the predictor measurement there is an associated response and vice versa.
    * Cluster analysis is one of the techniques used in unsupervised learning
        * Goal is to ascertain on the baseis of X (vector) whether the obs. will fall into relatively distinct groups.
    * Regression Vs Classification
        * Those problems in which we response variable is **quantitative** is called **regression** problem and vice versa.
