# Lifecycle
* Data Analysis or Data Preprocessing
* Feature Engineering
* Preprocessing
* Feature Selection
* Model Building
* Model Deplyment

# Data Analysis
* Missing Values (Only knowledge (not handling))
    * Number of missing values
    * Relationship between missing value and dependent variable.
* All the numerical variables
* Distribution of the numerical variables.
* Categorical Variables
* Cardinality of Categorical Variables which means how many categories are actually there.
* Outliers
* Relationship between independent and dependent features.

# Notes
* Year is also a numerical value.
* Write codes to find which are those columns.
* Analyse these temporal features. These are called temporal features because the current data will be dependent on previous data also.
* Then identify discrete and continuous variables leaving id and year if any.
* Further compare each other in a particular group (either discrete or continuous) with independent part.
* Use log normal transform it remove the skewness.
* Then check for outliers using boxplots (only for continuous vairbales).
